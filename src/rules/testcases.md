### Why take the time to make a testcase?

It saves time in the end. With testcases sites like JSFiddle we can see all of the relevant code, and are able to quickly (most of the time) determine what the problem is. Testcases also allow us to save different versions of your code, so that you can have a side-by-side comparison of the old and new code.
