# {{page.title}}

The #css channel exists to help people authoring or developing web
sites. #css and the staff are committed to providing a safe, helpful
environment to ask questions about CSS and web development.

Everyone must abide by the Rules of Conduct at all times. Additionally,
the Channel Guidelines and Topic can help you get the help you need
faster.

##Rules

The [Reasonable Person Principle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weigand/staff/)
applies.

* Everyone will be reasonable.
* Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
* No one is special.
* Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.

Additionally, please take note of the following:

* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
* Alert the staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in
  distress.

Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or
demeaning conduct are among the types of unreasonable behaviors deemed
to be unacceptable.

Harassing behavior includes, but is not limited to: offensive comments
related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
inappropriate use of sexual images or language; deliberate intimidation,
stalking or following; sustained disruption of channel activity;
unwelcome sexual attention; ignore and/or ban evasion.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
immediately. Everyone is expected to follow the rules.

If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the ops may take any
action they deem appropriate. Initial violations or violations believed
be unintentional, if not repeated, will likely only result in warnings.
Repeated violations or intentional harassment will be meet with
increasingly severe responses.

### If someone is breaking the rules…

If someone is breaking the rules, please ask them nicely to stop, once,
and point them here. If they continue to break the rules, please contact
a chanop.

Breaking the rules while trying to help enforce the rules is still
breaking the rules. Remember the Reasonable Person Principle.


##Channel Guidelines


###Topic

The #css channel is for discussing CSS with people who are writing CSS.
If you have a different problem, here are some other places where you
will get better help:

* CSS libraries
    * We can help, but you might get better help on a dedicated channel
    * Bootstrap - ##bootstrap
* JavaScript - ##javascript on Freenode
    * If your question involves clicking on something
    * JQuery - #jquery on Freenode
    * AngularJS - #angularjs on Freenode
    * Node.js - #node.js
* HTML - #html and #html5 on Freenode
    * If you need help deciding which markup tags to use
* PHP - ##php on Freenode
    * If your code sample has `<?php`
    * Wordpress - #wordpress
* Design - ##design on Freenode
    * If you want feedback on visuals
* Freelance - #css-lance on Freenode
    * If you are looking to hire or be hired
    * If you are in a hurry, you probably want to spend money
* Frontend - #frontend on Freenode
    * If you want to talk about general front–end development topics, such as CSS pre–processors, methodologies and tooling

If you are directed to another channel, please try there before asking
in #css again. Someone may still help from #css. Off-topic chatter is
not against the rules.
