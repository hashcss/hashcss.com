Selvvir is an IRC bot for the #css channel on freenode. It replaces the previous bot, rivvles, created by Colin Aarts (aka riven or lilmonkey on freenode) which the author still provides but chose to remove from #css.

Originally, Selvvir started as an attempt to reverse engineer rivvles (for no real reason). Shortly after its inception, the source code powering rivvles was made available on github as irc-js-bot. rivvles is presumably a custom configured irc-js-bot.

Selvvir is not exactly the cleanest code, and as such is closed-source. If you want Selvvir-like functionality, see the irc-js-bot project github repository and run that instead. irc-js-bot does not offer the caniuse.com functionality of Selvvir, but it is not hard to add.

Why neon green? rivvles' favorite color was hotpink. Ask Selvvir about `hotpink.
